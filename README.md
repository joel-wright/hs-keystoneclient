Start of some code to authenticate with Openstack Keystone.

This code is completely useless at the moment, and is mainly developed as an excuse to play with [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), [wreq](http://www.serpentine.com/wreq/), and [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/).

Maybe it will become useful in the future...
